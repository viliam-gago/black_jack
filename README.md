# Black-Jack

Black-Jack in "text" format. Game provides multiplayer for more than two players and runs with respect to known Black-Jack rules as split and double down.
It is convenient to use object-oriented programming when implementing this entertaining card game, and thus, it provides a great learning experience 
of this programming concept.

Although this is just 'command-line' game, it is well-structured and clear to enjoy playing.
